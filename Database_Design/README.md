The PharmaCare System utilizes a **Relational Database** with a **SQL Server** provider.

## Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)

The Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) visually represents the structure of the database.  
You can view the diagram here: [ERD](ERD.pdf).

In this phase, we mapped the relationships between entities and applied **data normalization** to ensure an efficient and organized database structure.

- **Schema Mapping**: View the schema and relations here: [Mapping](Mapping_Relations.pdf).  
- **Detailed Relations and Tables**: For more information about the relationships and tables, refer to: [Schema Details](Relations.md).
